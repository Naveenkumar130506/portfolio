- **Visual:** A professional photo of you or a subtle, clean dynamic abstract background (nodes/network/data streams).

> **Sample Text:**
> **H1:** Hi, I'm NAVEEN KUMAR N. I Turn Raw Data into Actionable Intelligence.
> **Sub:** Senior Computer Science Student specializing in Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics. Passionate about solving real-world problems with AI.
> **Buttons:** [View Projects] [Contact Me]

### B. About Me
**Purpose:** Humanize your profile and show your passion usually hidden in code.
**Content:**
- Brief background (University, Major).
- Why AI/Data Science? (Your "Spark").
- Career Goal (What role are you targeting?).

> **Sample Text:**
> "I am currently a final-year AI&DS undergrad at [University Name] with a deep fascination for how data shapes our decision-making. My journey started with a simple Python script to automate my math homework, which evolved into building neural networks that can diagnose diseases from X-rays. When I'm not training models, I'm reading about the latest in NLP or contributing to open-source data visualization libraries."

### C. Technical Skills
**Purpose:** Quick scanning for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and recruiters. Use a clean grid layout.

## 3. Realistic Student Projects (Recommended)

Choose 3 solid projects. Quality > Quantity.

### Project 1:MOVING OBJECT PREDICTION(End-to-End ML)
*Demonstrates: Data Cleaning, Regression, Deployment.*
- **Description:** A tool to predict real estate prices based on location, square footage, and amenities.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Flask/Streamlit, Docker.
- **Key Highlight:** "Deployed the model as a web app on Heroku; achieved an R² score of 0.85 on test data."
- **Link:** [Live Demo] | [GitHub Repo]

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter/Reddit (NLP)
*Demonstrates: API usage, NLP, Data Visualization.*
- **Description:** Scraped 10,000 tweets about [Current Topic/Movie] to visualize public sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Tweepy, NLTK/VADER, Plotly.
- **Key Highlight:** "Created dynamic word clouds and time-series graphs showing sentiment shifts over the week."

### Project 3:IMAGE ANALYSIS
*Demonstrates: Deep Learning, CNNs, Handling Medical Data.*
- **Description:** Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as 'Normal' or 'Pneumonia'.
- **Tech Stack:** PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras, Kaggle Datasets.
- **Key Highlight:** "Utilized Transfer Learning (ResNet50) to boost accuracy to 94% with limited training data."

## 4. Recommended Tech Stack
**Recommendation: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS**
*Why for a Student?*
1.  **Modern Standard:** React is the industry standard. Next.js adds built-in routing and SEO benefits (important for discoverability).
2.  **Performance:** Static Site Generation (SSG) makes the portfolio fast.
3.  **Ease of Deployment:** One-click deployment to **Vercel** (free).
4.  **Flexibility:** It allows you to easily embed interactive Python visualizations (via frames or APIs) later.

*Alternative (Simpler):* **HTML5 + Vanilla CSS + JavaScript**. Good if you want to prove "fundamental understanding" before frameworks, but less scalable.

## 5. UX/UI Best Practices
- **Visuals:** Use a "Dark Mode" aesthetic—it appeals to the developer/tech crowd. Accent with a vibrant color like detailed **Electric Blue (#007BFF)** or **Emerald Green (#10B981)**.
- **Typography:** Use sans-serif fonts.
    - Headers: *Inter* or *Montserrat* (Clean, modern).
    - Body: *Roboto* or *Open Sans* (Readable).
    - Code Snippets: *Fira Code* or *JetBrains Mono*.
- **Responsive:** MUST look good on mobile. Recruiters often check links on their phone first.
- **Whitespace:** Don't cram. Let the content breathe. This shows confidence.

## 6. SEO & Personal Branding
- **Keywords:** Sprinkle terms like "Machine Learning Engineer," "Data Analyst," "Python," "Predictive Modeling" in your H2 headings and About text.
- **Meta Tags:** Ensure your `<title>` is "Name | Data Science Portfolio" and description is accurate.
- **GitHub ReadMe:** Ensure every project linked has a *stellar* README.md. The portfolio gets them there; the README gets you the job.
- **LinkedIn Integration:** specific "Add to Profile" link or just a clear button.

## 7. Optional Enhancements (Version 2.0)
- **Blog:** Write short breakdowns of your projects. "How I built this..." articles show communication skills.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Embed a Tableau/PowerBI dashboard or a Streamlit app directly via an iframe.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Initialize the project.
2.  Set up the global design tokens (colors, fonts).
3.  Build the "Hero" and "Tech Stack" components first.
